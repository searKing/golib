// we are able to isolate it so that no other code can affect our seed.
// This is important,
// because another piece of code we import might also seed the math/rand package and
// cause all of our “random” functions to not really be that random.
// For example,
// if we seed with rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
// and then another initializer calls rand.Seed(1) our seed will get overridden,
// and that definitely isn’t what we want.
// By using a rand.Rand instance
// we are able to prevent this from happening to our random number generator.
